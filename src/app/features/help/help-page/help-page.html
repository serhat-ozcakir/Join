        <h3 class="help-main__subtitle">What is join</h3>
        <p class="help-main__text">Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of
            their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users
            manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
            It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
            business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
            availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.

        <ol>
            <li>
                Exploring the Board
                When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains
                four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating Contacts
                In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
                "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks
                and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adding Cards
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click
                the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card,
                like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
